Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text,
 especially in order to determine whether the writerâ€™s attitude towards a particular topic
 , product, subject etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

 In this data analysis project we analyse whether the market will be affected by the given news or not.
